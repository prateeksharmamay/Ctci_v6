# Cracking the coding interview in Java  

This repository is a collection of OOPs concepts, data structures and algorithm problems from the CTCI book.

## Chapter 1 : Arrays and Strings

| Problem   | Implementation |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>1.1 Is Unique:</b>  <br> Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?               | [Look](https://github.com/prateeksharmamay/Ctci_v6/blob/master/src/java/IsUnique.java)|
| <b>1.2 Check Permutation:</b>  <br> Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.               | [Look](https://github.com/prateeksharmamay/Ctci_v6/blob/master/src/java/CheckPermutation.java)|
| <b>1.3 URLify:</b>  <br> GWrite a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%2e: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)               | [Look](https://github.com/prateeksharmamay/Ctci_v6/blob/master/src/java/Urlify.java)|

## Chapter 2 : Linked Lists

| <b>1.1 Is Unique:</b>  <br> Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?               | [Look]()|
